My eldest son was looking at a skeleton toy(which had been taken out of its box by someone else before we arrived) and my youngest son had picked up one of the toys in its box and put it on the floor (he is only 24 months old). A blonde, extremely strict member of staff told us to leave the shop because of our 'behaviour' and also asked if we were stealing anything as we walked out. My friend who was queuing to pay for toys during this time was then asked, by the same woman, if she had paid for the items as she was leaving the shop. This was supposed to be a toy shop for children but the woman made it quite clear touching any of the toys was forbidden. I'm 41 and this is the first time iI have ever been thrown out of anywhere. We went to the farm and park today and were plannng to come back and visit the house but I am relucant to visit anywhere which is so intolerant of children.  ","time":1429124392},

No apology and not as advertised in the local media but there you go. \n\nNext visit was to the farm at £5 per adult and which was quite a walk away and no Tractor ride as this service ceased hours before the farm closed. Found a miniture train which cost extra £6.50 for 2 adults and child.\n\nDecided to leave to seek hot food elsewhere and joined rush hour traffic home.\n\nWill not be returning any-day soon.
