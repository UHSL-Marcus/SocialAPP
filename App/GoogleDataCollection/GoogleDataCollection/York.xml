The cathedral is magnificent.  The stained glass windows are awe inspiring.  I didn't pay to climb the stairs but I did pay to go inside.  This I found to be strange since most attractions in England (museums and the like) have been free.  But I don't mind paying for the restoration of this lovely building.  And it is quite lovely.  \n\nThe minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England.
